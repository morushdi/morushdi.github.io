title: "System Identification of a 6 m2 Kite Power System in Fixed-Tether Length Operation"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2020-08-01-AWE_SI
excerpt: 'A system identification algorithm was applied to evaluate the correlation between the tension force and the kite’s rolling angle over four tests, then come up with a transfer function that describes the system. Thereby enabling study the kite behavior as a preliminary step for the achievement of autonomous flight.'
