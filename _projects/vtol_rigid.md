A main challenge for AWE technology is how to automate the launching and landing. I worked on the AP-2 aircraft, developed by Ampyx power company, to formulate and solve the transition phase as an OCP using ICLOCS. I achieved the optimal trajectory based on a desired cost function, which is minimizing the power consumption, to the AWE community. This minimization of energy will cause a reduction in the total mass of the airborne component (especially battery) and this leads to enhancement in the flight operation. Also, achieving the required thrust to perform the transition, will help in modifying the AP-2 aircraft.
