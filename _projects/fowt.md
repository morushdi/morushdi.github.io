Analysing a LFM raw data collected over 6 years for 34 Typhoons at southern part of Japan using the Extreme Value Analysis (EVA) with Gumbel distribution to calculate the Expected Extreme Wind Speed (EEWS) for certain wind direction changes (WDC) during storms. This will be important information for FOWT farms, as it is a single point moored system.
