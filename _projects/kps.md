It is an airborne wind energy system, used for electricity generation. We built KCU to control the kite maneuver, performed several towing tests while collecting data using our MU. Then, I performed sensitivity analysis which agreed with model-based SA. After that, I applied machine learning algorithms and the neural network was promising to model and predict the tether force.
