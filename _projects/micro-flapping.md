Designed a micro air vehicle with low power consumption, low pollution emission, and low noise levels, using the theory of natural birds. Implemented the flapping bird in micro scale under aerodynamic and material constraints. Quantified the resultant aerodynamic force produced by a flapping wing in the fluid lab.
