Currently working on cutting edge research that aims to create a new generation of numerical finite volume schemes that replace the high order functions and linear and quadratic interpolation that are currently used as industry standards with new, more complex nonlinear schemes that use machine learning to reduce the reliance on mesh resolution. This strategy also seeks to get past the requirement for flow field smoothness in currently implemented techniques, which makes it very challenging to accurately solve discontinuous functions and non-smooth field functions.
