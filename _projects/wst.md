A wind-solar tower system was built in Chikushi campus, Kyushu University for electricity generation as a hybrid system that benefits from solar and wind energies. Several data entities were collected using sensors. Then, I applied machine learning algorithms to predict thermal updraft and wind turbine output for the cases of ”no wind turbine” and ”with wind turbine”, respectively.
