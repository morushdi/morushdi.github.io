**Welcome!** \
I am an energetic, results-oriented, Aeronautical Engineer. Currently, I am a research assistant professor at the Research Institute for Applied Mechanics ([RIAM](https://www.riam.kyushu-u.ac.jp/en/index-e.html)), Renewable Energy Integrated Utilization Section ([REIUS](https://www.riam.kyushu-u.ac.jp/REC/reiu_e.html)), Kyushu University. I received a PhD degree at Kyushu University in Fukuoka, Japan, and completed MSc and BSc degrees in Aeronautical and Aerospace Engineering from Cairo University, Egypt.

My research interests include ML/DL, Data science, control systems, guidance, embedded systems, optimization, and dynamics especially related to renewable energy systems.  In the past few years, I am focusing on applying state-of-the-art research in artificial intelligence into my work. 

I am from Egypt 🇪🇬. Currently, I am a permanent resident in Japan 🇯🇵. I am married to [Menna Fateen](https://mennafateen.github.io/) and I'm father of two sons. My hobbies are photography 📸, travel ✈️, and playing football ⚽️.
