(16/4/2023) Updating the website -- In progress 

Welcome! I am an energetic, results-oriented, Aeronautical Engineer. Currently, I am a research assistant professor at the Research Institute for Applied Mechanics (RIAM), Kyushu University. I received a PhD degree at Kyushu University in Fukuoka, Japan, and completed MSc and BSc degrees in Aeronautical and Aerospace Engineering from Cairo University, Egypt.

My research interests include ML/DL, Data science, control systems, guidance, embedded systems, optimization, and dynamics especially related to renewable energy systems. 

In the past few years, I am focusing on applying state-of-the-art research in artificial intelligence into my work. 

I am married to [Menna Fateen](mennafateen.github.io) and I'm father of two sons. My hobbies are photography, travel, and playing football.

<!-- Welcome! I am a data scientist applying machine learning tools and causal
inference techniques to remote sensing data. I am also an affiliated
researcher with the [Data-driven Analysis of Peace Project](https://dapp-lab.org)
and a research collaborator with the 
[Research on International Policy Implementation Lab](https://bridgingthegapproject.org/ripil).

I earned my Ph.D in Political Science from the
[University *of* North Carolina *at* Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu) and my
B.A. in Political Science from [Haverford College](https://www.haverford.edu).
My academic work has been [published](publications) or is forthcoming in
*International Studies Quarterly*, *Conflict Management and Peace Science*,
*Political Science Research and Methods*, and *PS: Political Science & Politics*,
among other outlets. This [research](research) explores the causes and
consequences of political violence using a broad variety of methods such as
latent variable models, geospatial analysis, and big data. While primarily
focused on civil conflict, it also examines contentious political phenomena
including terrorism and economic statecraft, and develops new measures of
institutions in international relations. I have [teaching](teaching) experience
in both quantitative methodology and international relations, and am a certified
instructor with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org). -->
