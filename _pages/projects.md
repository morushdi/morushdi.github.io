I have worked on several projects during my PhD, MSc, and BSc. Here is a glimpse of it, further description is available on my CV.

Machine Learning with CFD Applications
======

Currently working on cutting edge research that aims to create a new generation of numerical finite volume schemes that replace the high order functions and linear and quadratic interpolation that are currently used as industry standards with new, more complex nonlinear schemes that use machine learning to reduce the reliance on mesh resolution. This strategy also seeks to get past the requirement for flow field smoothness in currently implemented techniques, which makes it very challenging to accurately solve discontinuous functions and non-smooth field functions.

Floating Offshore Wind Turbine (FOWT)
======

Analysing a LFM raw data collected over 6 years for 34 Typhoons at southern part of Japan using the Extreme Value Analysis (EVA) with Gumbel distribution to calculate the Expected Extreme Wind Speed (EEWS) for certain wind direction changes (WDC) during storms. This will be important information for FOWT farms, as it is a single point moored system.

Wind Solar Tower (WST)
======

A wind-solar tower system was built in Chikushi campus, Kyushu University for electricity generation as a hybrid system that benefits from solar and wind energies. Several data entities were collected using sensors. Then, I applied machine learning algorithms to predict thermal updraft and wind turbine output for the cases of ”no wind turbine” and ”with wind turbine”, respectively.

Kite Power System (KPS)
======

It is an airborne wind energy system, used for electricity generation. We built KCU to control the kite maneuver, performed several towing tests while collecting data using our MU. Then, I performed sensitivity analysis which agreed with model-based SA. After that, I applied machine learning algorithms and the neural network was promising to model and predict the tether force.

VTOL Rigid Aircraft
======

A main challenge for AWE technology is how to automate the launching and landing. I worked on the AP-2 aircraft, developed by Ampyx power company, to formulate and solve the transition phase as an OCP using ICLOCS. I achieved the optimal trajectory based on a desired cost function, which is minimizing the power consumption, to the AWE community. This minimization of energy will cause a reduction in the total mass of the airborne component (especially battery) and this leads to enhancement in the flight operation. Also, achieving the required thrust to perform the transition, will help in modifying the AP-2 aircraft.

Micro-flapping Air Vehicle
======

Designed a micro air vehicle with low power consumption, low pollution emission, and low noise levels, using the theory of natural birds. Implemented the flapping bird in micro scale under aerodynamic and material constraints. Quantified the resultant aerodynamic force produced by a flapping wing in the fluid lab.

CANSAT
======

An Educational Nanosatellite microcontroller project utilizing various sensors, actuators, transmitters, and receivers.
