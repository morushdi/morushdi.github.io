Skills ⚙️
======
For a long time, I have been using a lot of computer tools, engineering programs, and programming languages. When I face a problem, I could learn some tools quickly and solve the problem or generate some results.

The important thing is that I could learn in a fast way and get the job done ;)

* Matlab
* Simulink
* Python
* ML & DL Libraries
* Latex
