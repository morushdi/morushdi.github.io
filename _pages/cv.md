Skills ⚙️
======
For a long time, I have been using a lot of computer tools, engineering programs, and programming languages. When I face a problem, I could learn some tools quickly and solve the problem or generate some results.

The important thing is that I could learn in a fast way and get the job done ;)

* Languages
  * Python / Jupyter
  * Matlab / Simulink
  * SQL
* ML & DL
  * Tensorflow
  * Scikit-Learn
* Visualization
  * Matplotlib
  * SciencePlots
  * Seaborn
  * Plotly
* Technical Writing
  * Latex
  * MS office
